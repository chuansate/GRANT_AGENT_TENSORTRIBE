The Industry4WRD Intervention Fund was launched by the Government in Budget 2019. It is a grant for Malaysian SMEs in the manufacturing and related services sectors to embrace Industry 4.0. MITI has appointed MIDA as the Implementing Agency for the Industry4WRD Intervention Fund.

The fund will be provided on matching basis (70:30) based on eligible expenditures, up to a maximum grant of Ringgit Malaysia Five Hundred Thousand (RM500,000.00) only. Maximum 30% of the matching amount (70% of total grant) will be provided in upfront to the companies subject to the approval by Intervention Fund Approval Committee at MITI, whereby the balance of the remaining grant will be on reimbursable basis which will be deliberated at MIDA.
